# 340W
Penn State University project for DS 340W regarding classifying breast cancer.

Image dataset and additional metadata was put directly onto a GPU Cluster where the code will run.

CBIS-DDSM Breast Cancer Classification using CNN + SHAP

This project is adapted from a deep-learning pipeline from the scientific paper, "An open codebase for enhancing transparency in deep learningbased breast cancer diagnosis utilizing CBIS-DDSM data for classifying breast masses as benign or malignant using cropped regions-of-interest (ROIs) from the CBIS-DDSM mammography dataset."

The workflow includes data preprocessing, ROI extraction, CNN training, performance evaluation, and SHAP interpretability analysis.
